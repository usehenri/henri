New `@usehenri/inertia` view engine: the Inertia.js protocol on Vite with React 19 pages and server-side rendering, selected with `"renderer": "inertia"`. Pages read the controller data with `useHenri()`, navigate with `<Link>` and submit with `<Form>` through Inertia's router. `henri new <app> --renderer inertia` scaffolds an application using it; `henri build` produces the client and server bundles.
