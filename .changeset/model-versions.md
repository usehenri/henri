Model versions: the history of a record, kept row by row.

A model asks, and nothing else changes:

```js
options: {
  versioned: true;
}
```

From then on every create, update and delete of that model writes one row into a table henri owns (`henri_versions`): when, the model, the record's **`externalId`** — never its primary key — the event, the attributes that moved as old to new, the actor and the request id.

**Off costs nothing, and off is the default.** No model saying `versioned` means no table created, no hook registered on any model, no middleware mounted and no boot line — the same bargain the call log makes. `config.versions` says only where the table lives and how long a row is kept; it turns nothing on.

**This is not the access trail, and the difference is the point.** The trail records field _names_, counts and digests and **refuses a value**. A version exists to hold the values: without the old value there is no reconstructing the record, and without that this would be a worse trail. The trail answers _who saw this record_, the call log answers _what did this request do_, and a version answers _what did this record used to say_. None of the three substitutes for another.

**What a row holds per event** follows one rule. A `create` holds every stored field as `[null, value]` — the new side already _is_ the record. An `update` holds the fields that moved, and **a soft delete is one of these**: the row is still in the table with `deletedAt` set, so the diff describes it exactly. Only a `destroy` — the row leaving the database — carries a `snapshot`, and that is the whole reason snapshots exist: a diff describes a change _to something_, and after a real delete there is no something left to fold back from.

**The actor and the request id are the join, and nothing carries them.** `base/request-id.js` already keeps the request id in an `AsyncLocalStorage`, and the module puts the signed-in person on the same store, so `record.save()` four calls deep in a service is recorded against whoever is signed in. Outside a request henri says so rather than guessing — `actor` is null, `source` is `system` — and `henri.versions.acting({ actor, source }, fn)` is how a job, a console session or a seed says better.

**It holds values, so it inherits the privacy machinery rather than sidestepping it.** In order: a field the model left out (`only` / `except`) is not stored and not named; **`password` is never stored** on any model, whatever `filterParameters` says; a field marked `encrypted` is stored as its **envelope**, written with the field's own context so it opens where the row's does, and never as its plaintext; and a name `filterParameters` matches is not stored. A change with no values is `null` rather than a masked string, because a mask is a value a restore would write into the column.

A field marked `personal` **is** stored, and the guide argues it: dropping it would empty the history of exactly the models worth versioning — who changed this person's address, and to what. What makes that safe is that the rows are reachable. `henri privacy:erase` reaches them (`versions.onErase`: `follow` takes the versions of a deleted record away and empties the erased values out of the versions of a record that survives; `delete` takes them all; `retain` leaves them and says so in the receipt, and in every case the person stops being an actor), `henri privacy:export` hands a person the history held about them, and the retention sweep prunes them (`versions.keep`).

**`reify` reads and `restore` writes**, which is the difference between them. `reify()` answers the record as it was immediately after a version, touching nothing, by folding **backwards** from the live record — backwards because the live row is the one thing certainly complete, and folding forwards from the create would answer a record that never existed the first time a version was pruned. It may be partial and says so. `restore()` puts that back — an update on a record that still exists, an insert under the same `externalId` on one that was destroyed, so every link that named it still does — and **refuses an inexact reconstruction** (`HENRI_VERSION_INCOMPLETE`) unless forced, because a read that is missing a field lets you see the gap and a write that is missing one would silently change the record.

**A mass write on a versioned model is refused** (`HENRI_VERSION_MASS_WRITE`). `Model.update(where, attrs)` runs the hooks once and without instances, so recording nothing for a hundred changed rows would make the history lie, and a history that silently misses changes reads as evidence and is not. Recording one entry per row was the other option and it was declined twice over: it turns an update into a full read of every matching row, and the read and the update are not one statement, so a row that changed in between would be recorded with a diff that never happened. The refusal names the loop that replaces it, `{ versions: false }` is the way through and is a decision rather than a silence, and Sequelize's `{ individualHooks: true }` is honoured as its own answer. A mass **create** is never refused: it has no before state, so nothing is lost.

`henri versions`, `henri versions:show` and `henri versions:restore` read it back with `--json` like everything else, the codes are the `version` area of the catalogue, and the guide is [Model versions](https://usehenri.io/guides/versions/).
