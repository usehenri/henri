An adapter that says what it ran, and the N+1 detection that follows from it.

`bullet` is the most-installed development tool in the Rails world after the linters, and henri had nothing like it. It had `include()`, a guide that told you to use it, and no way to find out when you had not. The reason nobody outside henri could write that check either was more basic: **no adapter emitted anything when it ran a query**, so there was nothing to listen to.

So there are two halves, in that order. `henri.queries` is the seam — every adapter reports every model call — and the N+1 detector is a listener on it, on in development and in test, off in production.

```
warn  queries  GET /proposals/:id  Track.findById ran 24 times at
               app/controllers/ProposalsController.js:41 (18.3ms) --
               load them together: one Track.find({ id: [...] }) for the
               whole set, or include('track') on the query that fetched
               the parents
```

**The seam is at the model call, not the statement**, and that is the decision everything else follows from. It is the only level at which henri can give _advice_ — a driver instrumentation can already tell you forty statements ran, and `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg` does that better than henri would; only henri knows they were forty `Proposal.findById` calls and that one `Proposal.find({ id: [...] })` replaces them. It is also the only level whose number you can act on: `paginate()` is two statements and one decision, and on MySQL so is an insert, because the dialect has no `RETURNING`.

And it is the level that matches what is actually wrong. Measuring the adapters rather than assuming: **`include()` on Drizzle compiles to a single correlated json subquery**, so the classic Rails lazy-association N+1 does not exist there at all. A detector written to `bullet`'s mental model would walk a Drizzle application, find nothing, and report success. What remains — a loop issuing one `find`/`findById` per record where one call for the set would do — is a count of model calls. So, said plainly everywhere because a person reading "40 queries" assumes the other thing: **the threshold counts model calls, never statements.**

**An event carries names and numbers, and no SQL.** `{ at, store, adapter, dialect, model, operation, method, keys, shape, duration, rows, requestId, source, callsite }`. At the model call there is no statement to carry, which is the happy half; the unhappy half is why it would have been refused anyway. **Sequelize's query generator interpolates values into the text it runs** — `findAll({ where: { name: 'ada' } })` reaches the driver as `WHERE "name" = 'ada'`, on the ordinary path — while Drizzle parameterizes and Mongoose has no statement at all. A `sql` field would have been safe on two adapters and a copy of your rows on the third, which is worse than no field because it is the leak nobody would look for. `keys` is column **names**, which is the rule the access trail already established: a field name is schema, a field value is personal data.

`callsite` is one frame, the first belonging to the application's own files. `bullet`'s value was never that it counted queries; it is that it names the line.

**The join is the request id and there is only one.** The same `AsyncLocalStorage` the call log keys its rows by, every `pen` line carries, and a span carries as `henri.request_id`. There is no trace id, and **telemetry deliberately does not consume this seam**: statements stay the driver's own instrumentation to trace, `adapter.query()` keeps its span and gains an event, and no model call ever becomes a span. `base/telemetry.js` was amended to say where that line now sits.

A finding goes to the log (one warning per request, at the end, when the count is final), to `X-Henri-Queries` in development, and — with `queries.detect.raise` — to a thrown `HENRI_QUERIES_N_PLUS_ONE` at the moment the threshold is crossed, so the stack names the call that went one too far. That last one is the CI gate, the way `Bullet.raise = true` is in a Rails suite. It does **not** go to `henri.reporter`: an N+1 is a slow answer, not a failure, and an application that wired Sentry to page someone should not be paged for a slow page. `henri audit` reports `queries.detect.raise` left on in a production configuration.

Each adapter maps its own layer. Drizzle and Sequelize wrap their statics, because both answer promises, plus Drizzle's `Relation.prototype` once per process for the lazy `where().toArray()` path. Mongoose uses schema middleware instead, because `Model.find()` answers a lazy chainable `Query` and wrapping it would have executed it early and turned every `find().sort()` in every henri application into a promise; the cost is that an operation that fans out (`populate`) reports once per operation rather than once per model call, which the guide says out loud.

**Off costs nothing**, the way the call log and telemetry mean it: no hook registered on any adapter, no middleware mounted, nothing allocated per query, and no flag tested on a hot path. Measured on Drizzle over in-memory sqlite — the harshest framing, since the call itself is only 26µs — the default adds 9.2µs per model call, two thirds of which is capturing the call site (`"callsites": false` drops it). Against a real database that is a fraction of a percent, and it is still off in production by default.

`config.queries` is the whole configuration: absent means on outside production, `false` is off everywhere, `{ "enabled": true }` is the production opt-in. The guide is [N+1 detection](https://usehenri.io/guides/queries/).
