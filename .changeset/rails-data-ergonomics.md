Rails ergonomics for models and the database: seeds, timestamps by default, soft deletes, `paginate()` and one validation error shape.

**Behaviour change: timestamps are on by default.** Every model now gets `createdAt` and `updatedAt`, like every Rails table; `options: { timestamps: false }` opts out. Before this, the Mongoose (`disk`, `mongoose`) and Drizzle adapters added them only with `options: { timestamps: true }` — the Sequelize adapters (`mysql`, `postgresql`, `mssql`) already added them by default, so nothing changes there. On MongoDB there is nothing to do; on Drizzle the models gain two `NOT NULL` columns, so a production database needs a migration (`henri db:generate`, then `henri db:migrate`) before deploying. `henri generate model` no longer writes `options: { timestamps: true }`. See the [upgrading guide](https://usehenri.io/upgrading/#timestamps-are-on-by-default).

**`henri db:seed` and `db/seeds.js`** (Rails' `db/seeds.rb`). Boots the models only — no views, no workers — requires `db/seeds.js` and awaits what it exports, with the models and the henri instance available. It works on every adapter, unlike the migration commands of `henri db`. `--file=<path>` runs another file, `--json` prints the result and the usual `{ error: { command, message, hint, code, exitCode } }` envelope, and a missing seed file is a usage error reported before anything boots. `henri new` scaffolds the file with the idempotent `find or create` idiom commented out.

**Soft deletes with `options: { paranoid: true }`** (Rails' `acts_as_paranoid`), on every adapter: deleting stamps `deletedAt`, queries hide the stamped records, `{ force: true }` really deletes and `restore()` brings a record back. Mongoose gets a schema plugin (query middleware plus replacements for `deleteOne`, `deleteMany`, `findOneAndDelete`, `findByIdAndDelete` and `doc.deleteOne()`), Sequelize uses its own `paranoid`, and Drizzle honours the scope in relations, `count()`, `update()` and `paginate()` and adds `withDeleted()`/`onlyDeleted()`.

**`Model.paginate({ page, perPage })`** on every adapter, answering `{ records, page, perPage, total, pages }`: `await Task.paginate(req.pagination())` replaces a find and a count, and everything else in the object is the adapter's own query (`where`, `sort`/`order`, `include`, `select`, ...). On Drizzle relations paginate too: `Task.where({ done: false }).paginate({ page: 2 })`.

**`henri.model.errors(error)`** turns a Mongoose, Sequelize or Drizzle validation failure — a duplicate key included — into `{ field: message }`, and answers `null` for anything else so a controller can rethrow. An error with no field of its own is filed under `base`.

The controllers written by `henri generate scaffold` and `crud` use `Model.paginate(req.pagination())` and `henri.model.errors()`, so a generated index is one query and a generated 422 has the same body on every store. Regenerate them with `--force` to pick both up.
