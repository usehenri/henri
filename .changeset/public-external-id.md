Every record gets a public uuid, and the numeric id stops leaving the server.

**This is a breaking change for an existing application: urls change, JSON payloads change, and a database migration is required.** The [upgrading guide](https://usehenri.io/upgrading/) has the migration for each adapter.

The primary key is unchanged — a `bigint` on SQL, an `ObjectId` on MongoDB — and it is still what the foreign keys, the joins and the indexes are made of. What changes is that it is now internal. Alongside it every model carries `externalId`: a uuid in an `external_id` column that is `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` in the database itself, generated on the insert when the caller brings none. It is the only identifier that leaves the server, so nothing outside can see or guess a sequential number: `/tasks/42` becomes `/tasks/0199a5c1-1f7e-7a3c-bb0d-2b1a4f6d9c11`, a serialized record has `externalId` and no `id` (no `_id` on MongoDB), and `_links`, the `Location` header of a `201`, the path helpers, the view options and `publicUser()` all carry the uuid.

The values are UUID version 7 (RFC 9562), time ordered: the column is unique, indexed and written on every insert, and a version 4 uuid would land in a different page of the b-tree every time where a version 7 appends to the right edge like the bigint it hides. `crypto.randomUUID()` only makes version 4, so the adapters generate their own; a uuid supplied by the caller is accepted whatever its version.

`Model.findById()` takes either identifier, so a controller keeps handing it `req.params.id`: a uuid is 36 characters with four dashes, and neither a number nor a 24 character `ObjectId` can look like one. `findByIdAndUpdate()`, `findByIdAndDelete()` and, on the Sequelize adapters, `findByPk()` take both too, and `findById()` is new on the Sequelize adapters.

Nothing about associations changes: `belongsTo`, `hasMany`, `include()` and `populate()` still work on the primary key, and a foreign key column still holds a number.

`options: { externalId: false }` opts a model out, and it then behaves exactly as it did before.
